- Players place their fleet of ships on a game board.
- Players take turns to shoot at cells on the opponent's board.
- The game continues until one player's entire fleet is sunk.
- The player who sinks the entire opponent's fleet first is the winner.

## Features

- Ship Placement: Players can place their ships on the board during the setup phase.
- Game Play: Players can shoot at the opponent's board and see the results of their shots.
